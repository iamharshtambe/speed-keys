## üìö Learning Path

**Suggested order for self-study:**

1. Start with **Linear Algebra** fundamentals (vectors, matrices, operations)
2. Build **Calculus** intuition (derivatives, gradients, chain rule)
3. Develop **Statistics & Probability** understanding (distributions, expected values)
4. Connect concepts through applications (PCA uses both linear algebra and statistics)
5. Practice **Optimization** techniques (gradient descent brings it all together)
